# React + TypeScript + Vite

Scaffolded with [create-vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

## React SOS

The task is to improve just the [`App.tsx`](https://github.com/simboonlong/react-sos/blob/master/src/App.tsx) file, you will only need to focus on this file. If you make any code change decisions, put a comment at that portion on the rationale why.

Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this.
